# DESCRIPTION
#
# After every commit to the dockapps git repository, run this script to
# update dockapps/dockapps.db, the plain text config file that stores all
# of the information for the dockapps section of windowmaker.org.
#
# The script uses git to determine the version numbers and tarball download
# urls.  Everything else is pulled in from dockapps.db.in, which is
# manually updated.
#
# The format of each dockapp entry in dockapps.db.in is:
#
# [dockapp name]
# image = (file name of image; in double quotes and comma-separated if more
#   than one image)
# description = (description, possibly taken from archive.org copy of
#   dockapps.windowmaker.org; in double quotes)
# url = (use archive.org copy if original homepage no longer exists)
# dockapps = (currently unused; id number from dockapps.windowmaker.org)
# category = (category from dockapps.windowmaker.org)
#
# After generating a new dockapps.db, submit a patch for the whome git repo
# to wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org.
