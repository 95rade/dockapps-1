   background of the dock of your window manager.)

                                  Description

   wmspaceclock (or spaceclock for short) is an antialiased analog clock
   for the Window Maker dock to show the current local time. wmspaceclock
   falls under the GPL (GNU General Public License)

   I wrote this program because I haven't found a nice antialiased analog
   clock for my [1]fluxbox slit. After searching the net I found only
   pclock and astime, but neither had the cool antialiasing hands of
   asclock_applet shipped with GNOME. I found the AfterStep version of
   the GNOME applet, but it didn't have that nice antialiased theme I
   wanted so much.

   The clock I liked most (though I wouldn't really use it) was
   wmfishtime by timecop <timecop at japan dot co dot jp>. I had a look
   at its source code, this was the one which inspired me to write my own
   clock applet. pclock was the second on my list, it lived in my fluxbox
   slit until I finished spaceclock. Also I have stolen some background
   pixmaps from the pclock distribution.

   Spaceclock uses a simple algorithm utilizing a subpixel mask to draw
   antialiased polygons. It could be enhanced further both in memory
   usage and output quality with a smarter algorithm, but the currently
   implemented approach seem to be acceptable for me.

   Why spaceclock? This is simple: I am a member of a small scene group
   called ([2]SpaceHawks). It was pretty straightforward to use the word
   "space" . Also, it is very useful to fill the unused space on your
   screen...

                                   Features

     * Window Maker dock applet (may be used with BlackBox of FluxBox as
       well)
     * Antialiased analog clock display
     * Background image loading via gdk-pixbuf
     * Configurable hand shapes via config file
     * Approximately 6-levels of transparency in current rasterizer
       implementation
     * Themes
     * Written from scratch using C++
     _________________________________________________________________

                                 Requirements

     * gdk-pixbuf is required to compile spaceclock
     * [3]STLport or other high performance STL implementation highly
       recommended (the version compiled with STLport uses 20 times less
       CPU time on my Mandrake 8.2 system with gcc 3.0.4)
     _________________________________________________________________

                                     Bugs

     * Configuration file loader should report more descriptive errors
       instead of throwing a never catched exception. Config file parser
       may have to be rewritten to fix this.
     * Segfault may happen if hands are too long and they are drawn
       outside of the 64x64 pixel applet area. Some checking may be
       approriate in the rasterizer algorithm.
     * Background pixmaps having other than 64x64 pixel size may result
       to unexpected behaviour. Possibly a meaningful error message would
       make sense.

                                 Major changes

     * 1.0 initial version
     * 1.1 fixed local time display
     * 1.2 implemented exact option
     _________________________________________________________________

                                   Download

     * Current source [4]spaceclock archive
     * Sourceforge [5]project page
     _________________________________________________________________

                                     Todo

     * Rasterizer quality should be improwed a bit.
     * Alpha channel for hands would be nice, it would make sense for the
       radar theme at least.
     * Some themes with shadows could be created.
     * Exact option is implemented now, but some things might be possible
       to make it more accurate.

   Thanks to Alexander Kourakos for his excellent clock applet called
   pclock. I used some nice pixmaps from his archive to make spaceclock
   look even better.

   Thanks to Timecop for the cool wmfishtime clock. I based parts of my
   program on his work.
