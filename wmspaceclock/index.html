		<h1>Description</h1>
		<p>
			wmspaceclock (or spaceclock for short) is an antialiased analog clock for
			the Window Maker dock to show the current local time. wmspaceclock falls under
			the GPL (GNU General Public License)
		</p>
		<p>
			I wrote this program because I haven't found a nice <b>antialiased</b> analog clock
			for my <a href="http://fluxbox.sf.net">fluxbox</a> slit. After searching the net I found
			only pclock and astime, but neither had the cool antialiasing hands of
			asclock_applet shipped with GNOME. I found the AfterStep version of the
			GNOME applet, but it didn't have that nice antialiased theme I wanted so much.
		</p>
		<p>
			The clock I liked most (though I wouldn't really use it) was wmfishtime by
			timecop &lt;timecop at japan dot co dot jp&gt;. I had a look at its source code, this was
			the one which inspired me to write my own clock applet. pclock was the second
			on my list, it lived in my fluxbox slit until I finished spaceclock. Also
			I have stolen some background pixmaps from the pclock distribution.
		</p>
		<p>
			Spaceclock uses a simple algorithm utilizing a subpixel mask to draw
			antialiased polygons. It could be enhanced further both in memory usage and
			output quality with a smarter algorithm, but the currently implemented approach
			seem to be acceptable for me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Why spaceclock? This is simple: I am a member of a small scene group called
			(<a href="http://www.spacehawks.hu">SpaceHawks</a>). It was pretty straightforward to use the word
			"space" . Also, it is very useful to fill the unused space on your screen...

		<h1>Features</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Window Maker dock applet (may be used with BlackBox of FluxBox as well)
			<li>Antialiased analog clock display
			<li>Background image loading via gdk-pixbuf
			<li>Configurable hand shapes via config file
			<li>Approximately 6-levels of transparency in current rasterizer implementation
			<li>Themes
			<li>Written from scratch using C++
		</ul>
		<hr>

		<h1>Requirements</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>gdk-pixbuf is required to compile spaceclock
			<li><a href="http://www.stlport.org">STLport</a> or other high performance
			   STL implementation <b>highly recommended</b> (the version
			   compiled with STLport uses 20 times less CPU time on my Mandrake 8.2 system
			   with gcc 3.0.4)
		</ul>
		<hr>

		<h1>Bugs</h1>
		<ul>
		<li>
	Configuration file loader should report more descriptive errors instead
	of throwing a never catched exception. Config file parser may have to
	be rewritten to fix this.
		<li>
	Segfault may happen if hands are too long and they are drawn outside
	of the 64x64 pixel applet area. Some checking may be approriate in
	the rasterizer algorithm.
		<li>
	Background pixmaps having other than 64x64 pixel size may result to
	unexpected behaviour. Possibly a meaningful error message would make
	sense.
		</ul>
		<hr>

		<h1>Major changes</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>1.0 initial version
			<li>1.1 fixed local time display
			<li>1.2 implemented exact option
			<li>1.2b pthread fix for BSD systems
			<li>1.2c various fixes
			<li>1.2d missing theme files added, new pclock theme thanks to Thomas Otto
		</ul>

		<h1>Todo</h1>
		<ul>
		<li>
	Rasterizer quality should be improwed a bit.
		<li>
	Alpha channel for hands would be nice, it would make sense for the radar theme at least.
		<li>
	Some themes with shadows could be created.
		<li>
	Exact option is implemented now, but some things might be possible to make it more accurate.
		</ul>

		<p>Thanks to Alexander Kourakos for his excellent clock applet called pclock.
		I used some nice pixmaps from his archive to make spaceclock look even better.</p>
		<p>Thanks to Timecop for the cool wmfishtime clock. I based parts of my program
